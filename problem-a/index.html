    <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></cite> is a cheerful and energetic sea sponge with a square shape.
        Residing in Bikini Bottom, he works at the Krusty Krab and is known for his eternal
        optimism, childlike innocence, and a knack for finding joy in the simplest things.
        SpongeBob's distinctive laugh, love for jellyfishing, and unwavering friendship with
        his best pal Patrick make him an endearing and iconic character in the world of animation.</p>
